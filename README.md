# Cello_bridges
Master thesis work - FEM cello bridges simulations

The repository contains significant data and code (Matlab).
Folders are organized in this way:
* Cello_bridges/Bridge Models contains the 3D models in .sat format of Model 0, 
also referred to as _Normal Model_, and Model 30, where Model 0 is the model most similar to a 
traditional French Cello Bridge and Model 30 is the model most similar to a Model X Cello Bridge.
* Cello_bridges/Animations contains animations of the modes of vibration, organized by boundary condition.
